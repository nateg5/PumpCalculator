      <p><a href="index.php">Pump Calculator</a> was created to help insulin dependent diabetics in estimating the best initial settings for their insulin pumps based on their age, body type, activity level and eating habits. However, the results from <a href="index.php">Pump Calculator</a> are only approximations and do not replace fasting basal tests and regular glucose monitoring. Every diabetic is unique in their reactions to food and insulin which is why it is always important to count carbohydrates and track your glucose testing results in a log book.</p>
      <p>Many variables can affect the amount of insulin your body needs, including: height, weight, age, gender, activity level and the number of carbohydrates you eat in a day. This is why it is important when using <a href="index.php">Pump Calculator</a> to fill out as much information as possible to get the most accurate results. If you are curious about exactly how these variables affect your insulin needs, then check out the <a href="howItWorks.php">How It Works</a> page for an in-depth explanation about how the <a href="index.php">Pump Calculator</a> formula works.</p>
      <p>Although <a href="index.php">Pump Calculator</a> is a new way of estimating the correct settings for your insulin pump, its formula is derived from traditional estimation methods. Older estimation methods are not personalized enough to provide accurate pump setting recommendations for every diabetic, leading to more frustrating highs and lows. See our <a href="resources.php">Resources</a> page to learn more about the research that went into developing <a href="index.php">Pump Calculator</a>.</p>
